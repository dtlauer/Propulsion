DONE - Determine clock, TMR frequencies
DONE - Write ISR
   DONE - clear TMR interrupt flag
   DONE - call PWM related functions
- Write main
    DONE - initialize
    DONE - infinite loop to run through states
    DONE - button logic (handled in interpretHallData() )
DONE - Implement both CCW and CW signal generation
- Write test code
    - generate three random numbers (1 or 0) to simulate Hall data
    - send to our functions to interpret and generate output
    - write input and output to a text file
    - write a function to verify our output
    - run the above steps in a loop and count correct implementations

- look up noise control for buttons
DONE - use MCC generated functions to clean up code
